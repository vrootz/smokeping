# smokeping
Stuff changed for smokeping from Oetiker


# teams_notify.sh 
Smokeping alert messages forwarded to Teams channel in a nice looking message card style.
Based on <b>slack_notify.sh</b> from <a href="https://github.com/tomwillfixit/smokeping/blob/master/slack_notify.sh">@tomwillfixit</a>, thanks for that!

Be aware of the lines which begins with <b>### CHANGE URL ###</b>, you need to change the smoekping individual URI and Teams Webhook URI!
